# Owanimo

Are you a mage in need of more magical power, but you don't want to invest in MP restoration items?

Do you often find yourself surrounded by colorful beings that are just BEGGING to be sent to another dimension?

Move them into a group of four or more and cast Owanimo, send them to the otherworld, and reap the mana rewards!
Need even more mana? Cast Owanimo consecutively, and the rift in spacetime will widen, causing more mana to be rewarded!
